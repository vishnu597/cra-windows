"""Keeps Windows/PARITY.md honest: every Mac feature has a row, and every upstream change has
been looked at.

  parity.py check [--upstream REF] [--base REF]
      Fails when
        - a Mac source file (Sources/Cra, Sources/CraCEF, Sources/CraHelper) or a CraCore source
          file is not named in PARITY.md, so a feature upstream added has no row yet;
        - a Mac command (KeyBindingDefaults.mac) or Settings pane Windows doesn't have yet is
          not named in PARITY.md;
        - with --upstream, main has merged upstream commits newer than the
          "upstream-reviewed" marker in PARITY.md (a sync that didn't update the tracker).
      With --base, warns (doesn't fail) when Windows/Sources changed and PARITY.md didn't.

  parity.py summary [--write]
      The status counts per area, from the rows; --write puts them in PARITY.md between the
      summary markers. check fails when the counts there are out of date.

  parity.py report [--upstream REF]
      Markdown for a CI summary: upstream commits after the marker (to triage), the Mac
      commands and Settings panes Windows doesn't have, and the CraCore types the Windows app
      doesn't use yet.

Names count when they appear in backticks: `MainWindowController.swift`, `SidebarStore`,
`toggleSidebar`, `privacy`. Digit-suffixed commands are written with N: `spaceN`.
